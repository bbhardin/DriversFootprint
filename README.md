# DriversFootprint
App I developed for Apple's 2021 WWDC Student Developer Challenge to predict a user's carbon footprint based on how much they drive to work. It compares the number of trees you would have to plant each year to offset your driving as well as how many hamburgers you would have to avoid eating to offset your environmental impact.
